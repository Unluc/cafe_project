It will ensure that all the required apps are installed.Please make sure that you are in the "apps_installation" folder before executing this command. 

Additionally, ensure that you have a file named "ubuntu_install.sh" in the same folder, which contains a list of all the required app names, with each app name on a new line.

Once you execute this command, it will automatically install all the apps listed in the "ubuntu_install.sh" file, allowing you to set up your project with the necessary dependencies efficiently.
